The IFC **Guides** can help you work with various aspects of the IFC system.

* The IFC [User Guide](#user-guide-internal) can help you read IFC files.
* The [Developer Guide](https://github.com/bigdoods/bigdoods.github.io/tree/{{page.githubbranch}}/docs/devel) can help you either write code to directly access IFC, or to contribute directly to the IFC project.


* (idea) gather all tooling that is used for accessing, querying, editing and updating IFC files that are independent of vendor influence and include them in user guide to promote usage.
